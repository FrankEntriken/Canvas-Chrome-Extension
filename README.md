# Canvas-Chrome-Extension

Disclaimer: This project is not available in the Chrome Web Store because the [Canvas OAuth2 Workflow](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html) is not currently implemented. Once I have implemented this authentification process I will likely upload this project to the Web Store.

## How does it work
The extension can be used by any enrolled Chapman student by downloading and unpacking the folder into their Chrome browser. The extension does require the user to manually generate a Canvas API token in the settings from their Canvas account. This allows the program to pull the necessary information from their account such as list of enrolled courses, assignments, and due dates. The program does not store any information locally or send your information elsewhere. The extension simply pulls information from the user's Canvas profile and displays it using HTML on the extension.

## Why is this useful
I created this Chrome extension to allow Chapman students the ability to check for any upcoming assignments from any webpage on Chrome. I am not the biggest fan of how Canvas displays their assignments and I think it takes too much time to check every course for upcoming assignments. This extension provides a much more convenient solution that students can interact with from any webpage on Chrome.
